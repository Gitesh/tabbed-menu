{"name":"Tabbed-menu","body":"### Tabbed Menu Generator.\r\n\r\nThese instructions show how to generate the navigational menu for web pages based on a 'folder tab' view.\r\n\r\n## 1. First create the tabs\r\n1.1. Open the file \"tabbed_menu_generator.html\"\r\n\r\n1.2. Edit the HTML and look for the line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n strPageList = \"tab1/tab1.html tab2/tab2.html tab3/tab3.html tab4/tab4.html tab5/tab5.html tab6/tab6.html\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.3.  Between the quotes, you will need to write out your menu structure in the format \"<tabname>/<webpage>\", where <tabname> is the link that will be displayed on the folder menu tab, and <webpage> is the page that will be displayed when the tab is clicked\r\n\r\n1.4. Save the page and open it in a browser to execute the javascript. Your menu will be displayed in the browser.\r\n\r\n1.5. You need to save your menu. View the source then save the page as a HTML file. \r\n\r\n1.6. You can then incorporate the web tabs in an iframe off your main view page to get a seamlessly switch between individual html pages tabs the are clicked. \r\n\r\n## 2. But how do I link my pages to the tabs?\r\n2.1 You need to create a physical directory structure to match the tab structure. Simply create folders in the same directory as your index page.\r\n\r\n2.2 The folder names should be the same as the tab names eg *tab1*, *tab2*.\r\n\r\n2.3 Within each folder, put the webpage that the tab links to eg *tab1.html* goes in the **tab1** folder you created above. *tab2.html* goes in the **tab2** folder...\r\n\r\nThat is it! \r\n\r\n### Licence\r\nThis template was originally created for [www.echobyte.co.uk](http://www.echobyte.co.uk).
